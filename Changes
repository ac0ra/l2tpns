* Wed Jun 23 2004 David Parrish <david@dparrish.com> 2.0.0
- Major release
- Completely replace active/standby clustering with a new peer-to-peer
  clustering method which allows much greater throughput and is a lot more fault
  tolerant
- Add internal tbf implementation for throttling without relying on tc and
  kernel HTB
- Add support for iBGP and eBGP to advertise routes
- Add cli commands "show cluster", "show bgp", "show ipcache", "show throttle",
  "show tbf", "suspend bgp", "restart bgp", "show user"
- Interception destination must be set per-user
- If SMP machine, allow use of SCHED_FIFO, which should improve performance
- Added config option to send GARP at startup
- Added plugin_become_master and plugin_new_session_master plugin hooks
- Remove useless sessionsendarp(). This isn't needed now that we are using TUN
  instead of TAP.
- ICMP rate limiting so not every unreachable packet is replied with an ICMP
  unreachable message
- mangle table is not required on anything but the cluster master, so slaves
  will drop the mangle table and attempt to unload the ip_conntrack module
- Statically assigned IP addresses (by Radius) work now
- Add -d command-line flag to detach and become a daemon
- Configuration file is now "/etc/l2tpns/startup-config"
- Reduced MIN_IP_SIZE to 0x19 to stop a pile of Short IP warnings
- Resend initial IPCP request until it's acknowleged by the client
- Better radius session cleanup logic
- Many miscellaenous bugfixes and performance enhancements
- Thanks to Michael O'Reilly and Brendan O'Dea for most of these new features

* Mon May 24 2004 David Parrish <david@dparrish.com> 1.2.0
- Fix SEGFAULT in garden module
- Use multiple radius sockets to allow more concurrent authentication requests
- Add username parameter to "show users" command
- Fix counting tunnel rx errors as tunnel tx errors
- Add "show throttle" command
- Add gcc __attribute__ to logging functions
- Fix warnings shown by __attribute__
- Make sure regular cleanup happens regularly under high load

- Add support for reading more than one packet per fd in each processing loop
- This is configurable with the multi_read_count variable
- Remove segv handler so core dumps can happen
- Use nonblocking sockets
- Increase tun queue length
- Fix minimum length of IP packets
- Remove per-packet plugin hooks (they are slow)
- Don't drop session if no free RADIUS
- Don't expire more than 1000 sessions per cleanup interval
- Remove -a and -c command-line options. They don't work anyway
- Don't require file: in log_filename
- Bump version to 1.2.0
- Check return code when throttling users

* Mon Apr 5 2004 David Parrish <david@dparrish.com> 1.1.1
- Don't mention configure anymore, it's not used
- Added the autosnoop and autothrottle modules
- Don't default to using a htb for the class root

* Fri Mar 5 2004 David Parrish <david@dparrish.com> 1.1.0
- Change all strcpy() calls to strncpy() to avoid buffer overflow potential
- Add ICMP host unreachable support
- Logging to syslog if log_file = "syslog:facility"
- Now requires libcli 1.5
- All configuration moves to a config structure
- Ability to modify and write config on the fly through command-line interface
- Config file support is removed, and now handled by the cli
- Show hostname in cli prompt
- Keep current state type for tunnels
- Add uptime command do CLI, which also shows real-time bandwidth utilisation
- Add goodbye command to cluster master, which forces droppping a slave
- Cache IP address allocation, so that reconnecting users get the same address
- Fix tunnel resend timeouts, so that dead tunnels will be cleaned up
- Allocate tunnels and radius without using a linked list which had issues
- Fix some off-by-one errors in tunnel and session and radius arrays
- Save and reload ip address pool when dieing
- Check version and size of reloaded data when restarting
- Remove plugin_config support
- Remove old support for TBF which didn't work anyway. HTB is required to do throttling now.
